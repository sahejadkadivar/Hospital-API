
# Hospital API 🚀
Welcome to the Hospital API. This API is designed for doctors and patients to manage patient reports and track patient health, aiming to control the spread of COVID-19 effectively.

## ⭐ Introduction

The Hospital API is designed to facilitate doctors working in a hospital designated by the government for COVID-19 patient testing, quarantine, and well-being management. It provides essential functionalities to manage patient data, track test results, allocate quarantine facilities, and ensure the overall health and safety of COVID-19 patients.

It is created using the REST API pattern and built with MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and Mongoose. Swagger is used to provide a testing UI.

## Features
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication system for doctors.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for managing resources.
- **Operations**: Create, read, and update doctors, and patients.
- **Relationships**: Establish relationships between hospitals, doctors, and patients.
- **Search**: Search functionality to find hospitals, doctors, and patients by various criteria.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and response messages.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing hospital, doctor, and patient data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords securely.
- **Swagger**: A tool for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs with an interactive user interface for testing.
